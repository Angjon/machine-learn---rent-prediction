## Objective
For this project the objective is to create a machine learning solution to predict the average rent in the city of SÃ£o Paulo. Alongside with the prediction, an API will be built to serve the model.

## Data exploration
Here it was imported the data containing all the information about renting in major cities of Brazil. In order to explore and build a robust model, it was decided to work on top of only SÃ£o Paulo data. To better visualize the data it was built graphs that would aid finding outliers and bad data.

## Data treatment
For this section it was removed any unwanted columns, outliers and bad data. Also it was established a correlation graph to verify which features present the most impact when it comes to rent price.

## Model creation
Using the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html" target="blank"> random forest regressor from scikit-learn </a> as the prediction model, it was possible to train the data and compare the results to the actual sample. After the model was built, using <a href="https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="blank"> joblib </a> it was exported to be further implemented in an API.
